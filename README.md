# kanban-board-vue-js

The project is a simplified copy of the Trello. <br />
Project demo is available here: https://groupbwt.github.io/kanban-board-vue-js/ <br />
This design was used for implementing UI: https://www.figma.com/file/odIzynKOUdBfpHccxxixrK <br />

## Technologies

This project was created to demonstrate the main capabilities of Vue.js and follows the [official style guides & best practices](https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/index.html). <br />
SCSS is used for managing styles. <br />
For better App performance the memorization is used. <br />

To implement the main functional, the following external dependencies were used:

- vuex
- vuex-persistedstate
- vue-i18n
- vuedraggable
- vee-validate

## Getting started

The application is built using vue-cli webpack - so to get started all you have to do is:

```bash
# install dependencies
> npm install

# compiles and hot-reloads for development at localhost:8080
> npm run serve
```

Other commands available are:
